# Frontend Pages

The App.js file contains placeholders for the full page components. 
You need to replace these with the complete implementations from the documentation.

2. **implementation-guide-part5.md** - Dashboard, ChatRoom, ChatRoomList, AIAssistant, Appointments

## Quick Start:

1. Create each file in `frontend/src/pages/`
2. Copy the complete component code from the implementation guides
3. The App.js routing is already set up and will work once components are added
4. All necessary imports and services are already configured

All components use Material-UI and are fully styled and functional.
